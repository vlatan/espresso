# Espresso (Home vs. Coffee Shop)

Comparison of the cumulative costs over time and figuring out when they intersect. 
In other words, after how many days of drinking homemade espresso it will 
actually become cheaper for you to make your espresso at home than having 
your espresso in a coffee shop, in relation to what type of coffee you use and what kind 
of espresso machine you use.
